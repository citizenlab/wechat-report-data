# WeChat dynamic analysis setup
This will walk you through setup for WeChat mobile app on Android (for either an emulated or rooted device), and setup for both Wireshark and Frida instrumentation for analysis.
1. ADB setup
For emulation:
Android Studio, create new image of Pixel 5 API 32 with at least 5GB internal storage, optionally more in SD card if you’d like.
```
brew install android-platform-tools
```
If using real device, make sure device is rooted, connect using USB.
`adb devices` should list either the emulated or the rooted device.
Run `adb root`.
2. WeChat setup
Download Wechat APK compiled form arm64-v8a / armeabi-v7a (assuming wechat.apk) from the [official version list](https://weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/readtemplate?lang=zh_CN&t=weixin_faq_list).
We are looking at version 8.0.23 / 2160 APK, fetched from `https://dldir1.qq.com/weixin/android/weixin8023android2160_arm64_1.apk`.
```
apk install wechat.apk
```

3. Network inspection setup
tcpdump should already be installed on the Android device if the version is recent. Similarly, on the host device, if android-platform-tools is installed then androiddump should be installed as well.
On host computer, ensure “tshark -D” lists an android interface. For an emulator this should be something like “android-tcpdump-any-emulator-5554”. You should then be able to sniff all traffic on the Android device with Wireshark by selecting this interface.
4. Frida setup
[Frida docs for Android](https://frida.re/docs/android/)
Download [frida-server](https://github.com/frida/frida/releases) for the correct architecture of your emulated or real device (in my case, android-arm64)
```
pip3 install frida-tools
adb push frida-server /data/local/tmp/
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"
```
5. Putting it all together
To test to make sure it is working, on host, type:
```
frida-trace -U -i “Java_com_tencent_mm_protocal_*” WeChat
```

Then on the WeChat application, change the application language (this should be possible even without logging in). This will consistently generate a single MMTLS request. Frida should see a single call to 
```
Java_com_tencent_mm_protocal_MMProtocalJni_packHybridEcdh()
Java_com_tencent_mm_protocal_MMProtocalJni_unpack()
```
per MMTLS request. You can verify that a single MMTLS request has occurred via Wireshark.
Mobile static analysis
For static analysis we are mostly using [JADX](https://github.com/skylot/jadx) and the associated GUI. 

## Running these scripts

These scripts should work by running:
```
frida -U -f com.tencent.mm -l [frida-script].js
```
